# Student API

This is a simple **REST API** I built using **Node.js and Express.js** as part of my learning in backend development.  
The API manages basic **student information** like name, major, and GPA, and it performs the usual CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

I made this project to practice building backend systems, working with routes, JSON data, and HTTP requests ‚Äî all essential concepts in web development.
